# Top Rules

The following project rules apply to this service and to the document suite. Source: top_rules.md — that file must not be changed.

**Rule 1.** You may not change anything in top_rules.md.

**Rule 2.** top_rules.md sets project and limitations. The following files must exist where required: readme.md (deployment plan); progress.md (progress tracking); newtask.txt (debugging focus); changed_files.md (tracking edited files). Create any of these if they do not exist, or ensure the deployment plan includes a step to create them.

**Rule 3.** readme.md contains the deployment plan numbered as 1.a, 1.b, etc.

**Rule 4.** progress.md lists progress after each step in the deployment plan (readme.md), including detailed results of tests created for any coded function. Use pytest. Use the same numbering as readme.md. Do not suggest advancing before all tests are cleared. If tests are blocked (e.g. by environment or database), document the blocker in progress.md and suggest how to unblock. After each step, check that all rules are followed, update progress.md, and include a list of the tests deployed and the result of each test.

**Rule 5.** initial_sql_design.txt holds a suggested design of the database; use only as reference.

**Rule 6.** A previous version of the project (minimal function prototype) exist within the folder _obs_gateway_repo

**Rule 7.** Use Docker to contain the application fully. Use virtual environment where applicable

**Rule 8.** The application will need API keys: include suggested rules (storage, rotation, expiry, revocation) and procedures and maintenance in the deployment plan (readme.md).

**Rule 9.** When appropriate, create a script that tests all API endpoints according to the capability statement.

**Rule 10.** The local database is based on FLASK and PostgreSQL and is localhost to begin with.

**Rule 11.** All results of tests etc. are stored in ./results/<timestamp>results/ (ISO-8601 UTC; e.g. 2026-02-19T14-30-00Z_results).

**Rule 12.** Whenever something is changed on the web level: first download what is to be changed to a temporary archive, then compare with what is locally available. Then, without coding anything, present the result of the comparisons and suggest the next step. The result should always be that we have the same locally as on the web. All transfer and management on the web is done by the operator based on instructions. No ssh or scp from the plan.

**Rule 13.** (Later in project.) Present focus is given in newtask.txt. Create it if it does not exist when needed (debugging phase). This file is an extension of the readme.

**Rule 14.** Maintain GIT structure separately but do not touch folder _obs_gateway_repo

**Rule 15.** Put priority on being fully compliant with FHIR 5. FHIR compliance is enforced for API schema, DB model, capability statement and validation layer.

**Rule 16.** Assume ownership of ports 9000–9003 on localhost. Kill all (9000–9003) before starting any program. Use only those ports. If practical, use the database on localhost:9020. Starting the database and other applications must be collected in a single bash script (./start.sh): kill previously used project ports (9000–9003), activate venv, start the DB and app; on Ctrl+C gracefully shut down and deactivate. See to that docker is started properly or is running when activating the application.

**Rule 17.** Note in changed_files.md all edited files from now on, with full path.

**Rule 18.** For robustness: all internal traffic should be guided by references to GUIDs whenever possible. All matching of activities/transactions/goals must use GUID, not ID. Frontend communication is based on GUIDs. Backend always refers to GUIDs.

**Rule 19.** The operator does all editing on the web application. You prepare scripts for updating the web instance following analysis. When restart is necessary, run safe_restart.sh on the web instance (the script is prepared as part of the plan or is present on the web instance).

**Rule 20.** Create a script that tests all API endpoints according to the capability statement.

**Rule 21.** Keep the created app in a separate folder including its venv and database. Make sure to update the requirements.txt file with the dependencies of the app.Keep the root clean.

**Rule 22.** The future implementation on the server is fragile and all precaution must be taken to prevent disturbance of other services in the reverse proxy

**Rule23** the .env must be fully prepared and boot strap SU user must be possible to create in the first implementation on the server (macmini). Development is done on tha local MAC.
